Hello, this is GM Lisha.  
A beta test has begun for World Boss, a new type of challenge content where players can challenge powerful bosses and compete for higher rankings. We are conducting this beta test to lay the groundwork for a more stable service once regular seasons begin, and we are hoping to hear any feedback our players have to share with us.Â We've also prepared gifts for everyone who participates, and we're looking forward to your participation! ðŸ˜Š **â–  World Boss Beta Test Survey Event**
