**The Action Anime, OUTERPLANE**  
Hello, Masters! This is GM Lisha.  

Get ready for the second **OUTERPLANE Global Stream on Tuesday, August 22nd at 5:00 PM PT!**

But here's the twist: you take the reins this time! We'll be assembling a squad using 1 star heroes,  
and their selection, gear choices, and more will be driven by your insights.  
We will also challenge Arena and Skyward Tower where you can participate in a fun minigame to snag some giveaways! And if that wasn’t tempting enough, we're unveiling some exclusive information as well! Join the stream and be the first to find out!
