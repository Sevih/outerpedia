**The Action Anime, OUTERPLANE**

**Hello, Masters!**

**This is GM Lisha.**

As pre-registration has ended, certain sections of the notice have been edited to accommodate the changes.

We are excited to announce that OUTERPLANE has officially launched globally on 5/23! 👏👏

We are also pleased to inform you that we are still accepting applications for the "OUTERPLANE Partner Program".

For more information about the program, please visit the following page:

Here are some frequently asked questions (FAQ) for those who are interested:

**< FAQ >**

**Q. Will I be registered as an official OUTERPLANE partner?**  
 A. This program is designed to support creators of good content related to OUTERPLANE and is not intended for selecting  
official partners. Smilegate will not review the content created, and all responsibility for the content belongs to the creators. **Q. Can I be rejected as a partner after being selected?**

A. Yes, if you fail to create content at least once a week, you will be rejected after 2 separate warnings have been accumulated.

Also, if the content you create is deemed inappropriate, such as using works by other people, using inappropriate language, or featuring sexual content, you will be immediately excluded from the applicants and disqualified from your OUTERPLANE partnership.

**Q.** **Will my content be uploaded to the official OUTERPLANE channel?**

A. No, your content will not be uploaded to the official OUTERPLANE channel. 

You can upload it to your personal channel and promote it on the official community.

**Q. Is there a deadline for application or a specific period during which I can be a partner?** 

A. There is no application deadline for the OUTERPLANE Partner Program as partners will be selected every month. 

If you no longer wish to be a partner, please send an email to outerplane\_partner\_EN@smilegate.com.

**Q. How are the "Partners of Excellence" selected?**

A. They will be selected based on the quality and quantity of content created each month.  
The channel's influence, such as the number of subscribers and views, will not be considered. A score will be given every quarter based on their monthly activities, and the highest-scoring partners will be recognized as "Partners of Excellence." 

  
 We eagerly await the participation of our Masters who will create amazing content.

We encourage many of our Masters to apply for the program.

Thank you.
