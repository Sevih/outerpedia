**■ The probability of increasing each substat when reforging gear**  
\- When adding a substat by reforging, the probability will be 1/N, excluding the existing substat.  
\- Up to 4 substats can be applied.- When reforging a gear with 4 substats, it will have a 25% chance to increase the stage of one of the existing substats.※ If the substat reached stage 6, a different substat will be increased, excluding the one that reached stage 6.

**■ Substat Change (Change All)**  
\- We would like to provide information on the probabilities of substats in each slot when changing substats using Transistone (Total).
