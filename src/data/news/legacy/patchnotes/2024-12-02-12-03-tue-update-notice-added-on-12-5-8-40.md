Clearing a lower difficulty unlocks the higher difficulty.      ㄴ Rankings are determined based on how much HP has been lost and number of entries of the Masters in the battle.           However, there are no differences in rewards based on rankings.      ㄴ Each Extermination Project lasts for 24 hours after the start, and Masters can enter the same battle up to three times.      ㄴ Participation in Extermination Projects consumes Stamina.            If re-entering the same battle, the amount of Stamina consumed decreases.      ㄴ You can participate in up to 10 Extermination Projects per boss. ![](/images/news/legacy/patchnotes/2024-12-02-12-03-tue-update-notice-added-on-12-5-8-40/1f84985684ce4a5994af082ce910ef62.webp)

           Refined Upgrade Stone Chests, Hammers, and Present Chests.        ㄴ Gold is awarded upon participation, with the quantity of final rewards varying based on the success or failure            of the boss extermination and the selected difficulty.
