 - Some changes will be made to the skill effects of the boss monster 'Planet Purification Unit'.  
     1) The damage inflicted by 'Command: Destroy' on enemies that are not Healers has been significantly increased.     2) 'Command: Destroy' will prioritize attacking healer enemies first. If there are no healer enemies present, the skill will be used on a random target.     3) The effect for Enraged will be adjusted.

    2) An issue where when enabling the Geas, 'Boss monsters have an additional enrage (at 70% Health)', the Planet Purification Unit did not apply the Invulnerability buff. This issue has been resolved by adjusting the Enraged effect to ensure that the Invulnerability buff is not applied at any stage.
