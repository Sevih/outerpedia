※ Once you have agreed to the \[Service Transfer\], it cannot be reversed.

※ A transfer code must be issued once for each character created on each server, not per account.

※ Accounts that do not agree to the \[Service Transfer\] can play the game until the maintenance on September 23, 2025 (Tue).

 After the maintenance ends on September 26 (Fri), the game will no longer be accessible.
