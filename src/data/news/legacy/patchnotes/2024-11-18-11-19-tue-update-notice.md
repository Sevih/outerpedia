ㄴ Before: 25% of damage dealt to allies is redirected to Edelweiss. Does not stack with other gear effects of the same type.                                     Cannot be removed until Edelweiss is defeated.

                     Only the highest value will be applied. Cannot be removed until Edelweiss is defeated.  

  
**12\. Error Fixes**

\- Fixed an issue where a red dot continues to appear in the lobby even after all free items in the shop have been purchased.

\- Fixed an issue where the duration of Enraged for the boss monster "Demiurge Drakhan" was different from  
   what was indicated in the tooltip.  
   ㄴ The duration of Enraged was displayed as 3 turns, but it was actually applied as 2 turns.

\- Fixed an issue where players couldn't obtain Guild Buffs.

\- Fixed an issue where buff durations would occasionally not decrease correctly when gear or heroes  
   that grant buffs at the start of battle were present.  
   ㄴ  e.g. The duration of Bryn's "Charisma" effect will now decrease normally after Valentine's Lucky or Die is used.

\- Fixed an issue in Chapter 11 of Fatal Side Story and Chapter 10 of Bryn's Side Story  
   where the explosion effect in the boss monster's "Overwhelming Performance" was not applied.

\- Fixed an issue where the missions "Clear (Stage 10 or higher) 10 times with Auto-Battling" and "Clear (Stage 10 or higher)  
   20 times with Auto-Battling" in the Challenge! Special Request Mission Event would not complete under certain conditions.  
   ㄴ For those who already achieved these missions before the 11/19 (Tue) update,         the mission gauge will be automatically updated.    ㄴ These missions cannot be completed with Sweep and require Auto-Battling.

\- Fixed an issue where using an ultimate with Lisha or Adelie, equipped with their +10 exclusive gear  
   and with only one enemy remaining, would cause the game to crash.

\- Fixed an issue where, in the new user buff acquisition popup,  
   selecting a new buff again would cause the buff list to display abnormally.

\- Fixed an issue where the boss monster "Mero" in the Skyward Tower Very Hard mode would not summon its Doppelgänger.

\- Fixed an issue where, under certain circumstances, selecting "Retry" after clearing a stage  
   in the Skyward Tower Very Hard mode would consume a ticket but only award a normal clear reward.  
   ㄴ This issue occurred specifically on stages eligible for normal rewards          after the Skyward Tower reset, prior to the 11/19 (Tue) update.         Normally, after clearing a stage eligible for normal rewards and retrying it,          players should have access to "Enter Practice Battle" without consuming additional tickets or obtaining clear rewards.                         However, the system was not switching to "Enter Practice Battle" on retry,          resulting in the unintended consumption of tickets and the ability to obtain clear rewards.         This issue has now been fixed.

\- Fixed an issue where stat changes continued during Continuous Stat Change in the Precise Craft screen,  
   even after the selected stat values were displayed.      
   ㄴ Compensation will be provided for any additional Effectium consumed due to this issue,          and further details will be announced in a separate notice.                 We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused.
