  ㄴ We have thoroughly investigated the issue and confirmed that there are no issues with its logic.  
      : Counterattack, Revenge, and Agile Response are triggered when one of the allies meets the triggering condition and Cannot Counterattack effect only prevents Counterattack, Revenge, and Agile Response that are triggered right after the skill is used.

    Example) When Dahlia uses her Skill 3, preventing Counterattacks, and Charlotte subsequently uses her Skill 2, if Demiurge Stella's Revenge is triggered, Dahlia's Skill 3 does not trigger Revenge. However, since an ally is inflicted with a debuff due to Dahlia's Skill 3 while Charlotte uses her Skill 2, Charlotte's move triggers Revenge. (Revenge skill description: Counterattacks when a debuff is inflicted on an ally during an enemy's turn.) 

   ㄴ However, as there is a lack of description for the above logic, we have added additional texts for the following effects. 

       Before: Does not trigger an enemy's Counterattack, Revenge, or Agile Response..   
       After: Right after using this skill, it has a chance to avoid triggering an enemy's Counterattack, Revenge, or Agile Response. 

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused   
1 Time Rewinder will be sent to your in-game mailbox as compensation.
