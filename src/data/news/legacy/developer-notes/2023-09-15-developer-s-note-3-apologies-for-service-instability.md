Hello, Masters.                                                                                          
This is Moonsoo Hyun, the producer for OUTERPLANE.  
 

In today's Developer's Note, we would like to extend our heartfelt apologies for the inconvenience caused by various issues and provide a brief overview of the upcoming updates planned for the second half of this year.

  
The completion of the first part of Season 2 on 8/29 was intended to bring joy to our Masters, but unfortunately, it resulted in inconveniences due to various issues. We deeply apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced.  
 Our initial goal was to add planned update content to minimize any periods where our Masters might lack engaging content. However, we understand that this led to a decline in service quality. We are committed to reevaluating our internal development processes to ensure service stability and prevent such inconveniences in the future.

**◈ Update Information for the Second Half of the Year**

  
Here's a glimpse of what's in store with our upcoming updates for the second half of the year:  
Among the promised update details mentioned in the previous note, most have been implemented, except for the addition of Light and Dark armor/weapon raid dungeons. Initially, both Light and Dark raid dungeons were scheduled for release on 9/12. However, due to ongoing service instability and our focus on improving service quality, we have decided to release the Light and Dark armor/weapon dungeons separately. We appreciate your understanding regarding the delay in content updates. The main content updates planned are as follows (please note that these may be subject to change based on development schedules):  
  
**1) Light/Dark Element Armor Raid**

**2) Light/Dark Element Weapon Raid**

**3) Elemental Tower**

     : A content designed to offer consistent rewards at moderate difficulties, distinct from the Skyward Tower.

**4) World Boss**

     : Engage in a battle against a formidable boss, competing individually against players from the entire server.

       This content is designed to motivate players aiming for PvE excellence.

**5) Real-time Arena**

     : The long-awaited Real-time Arena will make its debut in the latter half of this year.  
  
 We also plan to implement the following improvements to enhance your gameplay experience:

  
**1) QoL Improvements**  
     : We have received numerous QoL improvement suggestions since launch and have already implemented some.

       Additional QoL improvements are in the pipeline.  
 **2) Balance Adjustments**

     : We intend to readjust the fundamental balance and make necessary adjustments to hero and item effects before the release of the Real-time Arena.  
 

Throughout the latter half of the year, we will continue to make updates based on the outlined content, adding a new regular event area each month.  
  
 While we have plans to expand Skyward Tower Hard Mode and The Archdemon's Ruins, as well as make improvements that boost overall participation rates and tweak the difficulty of existing content based on comprehensive data analysis, our immediate priority is to allocate development resources toward balance adjustments, improving overall service stability, and enhancing QoL, rather than introducing new systems or content.

* * *

It's been over 100 days since OUTERPLANE's official launch.  
  
We want to express our gratitude for the incredible support our Masters have shown.  While Eva's Master may be "K," we always remember that OUTERPLANE's true Masters are our players. As developers, we are committed to delivering stable services and enjoyable content for as long as possible.

We look forward to bringing you even more exciting content in the future.  
 

As a token of our appreciation for your patience and loyalty, we have prepared special celebration gifts in honor of this Developer's Note.
