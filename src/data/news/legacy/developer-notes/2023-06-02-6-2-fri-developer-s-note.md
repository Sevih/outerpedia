Hello, Masters.  
This is Moonsoo Hyun, the producer of OUTERPLANE.  
We are truly happy and grateful to have been able to officially launch the game on the planned date of May 23rd. We would like to thank all our players who have believed in us and shown us patience. As for myself, I have been hard at work since the official launch playing the game alongside everyone else and preparing for upcoming updates.

Seeing so many players enjoy the game is really encouraging for us at the development team,  
and we are working hard every day to continue developing the game.  
At the same time, we are aware of the various issues affecting the game, such as bugs, connection instability, and other issues spread throughout different areas of content. We take these issues very seriously, and I would like to take this opportunity apologize for any inconvenience you might have experienced.Currently, our team is in the process of preparing improvements for the game while working with Smilegate Megaport, our publisher, to review player feedback and statistics from the game. We hope to provide you with continued improvements alongside our planned updates.Today, I'd like to introduce you to some improvements and updates we have planned for the 7th of June, and beyond the topics discussed today, we'll continue to keep our eyes and ears open for player feedback to bring you a more enjoyable gaming experience.

**▶ 6/7 Maintenance and Update**

**\# Key Improvements**

**1\. Improvements to Recruitment: Mileage carryover and increased recruitment chance**  
First, let's take a look at improvements to recruitment.  
Mileage obtained while recruiting heroes will no longer disappear, and instead carry over into the next drop rate up recruitment. Hero recruitment chance will also be increased, allowing players to obtain new heroes and drop rate up heroes more easily. While we also plan to bring improvements to the products and perks available in the shop, we have decided to prioritize improving recruitment, the feature most often used by players, in order to lower the difficulty of acquiring new heroes.※ Mileage carryover will begin with the currently ongoing Rin and Valentine Drop Rate Up Recruitments, and remaining mileage will not be converted into Star's Memory.

**2\. Improvements to Hero Pieces: Regular events and cost re-evaluation**

**A.**     Many players have brought up the issue of difficulty related to collecting pieces to transcend heroes,  
         and we plan to prioritize looking into possible solutions and relaxing its difficulty.  
         We plan to lower the cost associated with hero transcendence from where it was initially so that 6 star heroes          become attainable with less resources and effort.

**B.**      Specifically, starting from June 7th, there will be regular events providing increased drop rate for pieces,  
          and the pieces of certain heroes will be made available through upcoming event and content rewards.   

**C.**      The value of 6-star transcendence will also be adjusted in order to progressively  
           bring down their total cost in terms of time and resources.  
           These changes are still a work in progress, and we will provide additional details through a future notification.

**\# 6/7 Update Notice**

While this update will come with a variety of changes such as bug fixes, stability improvements, resource modifications, the notable contents of the update will consist of the following three elements.  
  

**1\. New Character**

**\[Eternal\]**  
Eternal is a charming yet deadly hero (fire element/mage/enchanter)  
capable of inflicting a wide range of powerful debuffs to enemies. She can provide versatile support in battle with her debuffs that reduce Defense and Speed.

  
As she provides speed and stability in clearing fire element armor and weapon raids,  
we expect to see her widespread adoption.

**2\. Guild Raid**

![](/images/news/legacy/developer-notes/2023-06-02-6-2-fri-developer-s-note/fd07191d5f244872a46db235ae4d70b5.webp)

   **i.**    In Guild Raid, you will cooperate with your guildmates to challenge powerful bosses  
        and compete with other guilds over the course of 2 weeks to reach the top of the leaderboard.  

  **ii.**  There you will find sub bosses called Geas Guardians and a main boss based on each season's theme.  
        You must work with your guildmates to first defeat the Geas Guardians,  
        then use the Geasa you've acquired to take on the main boss as efficiently as possible and reach for the highest score.

 **iii.**   This season's Guild Raid will feature \[Devout Follower of Scientific Inheritance Maxwell\].  
        Challenge Maxwell who has been reborn as a powerful water element boss to obtain various rewards  
        with your fellow guild members.

 iv.   Developer's Gameplay Tip

    1) Working with your guild members, first defeat the Geas Guardians and make use of the various  
         Geasa you acquire to help you in your fight against the boss.

     2)  Scientific Inheritance Devotee Maxwell is weak against earth element heroes.  
          Laine, Yuri, and Alice will be especially effective at countering his main mechanic.

**3\. Event Dungeon**

An event dungeon, The Reaper and the Gangster, will be added. You will be able to check out a short story of the  
new hero Eternal and obtain various rewards.  
You will also be able to get a cute mascot character based on Eternal, so please make sure to enjoy this new content!

There will also be other various improvements and changes.  
We will provide the details in the 6/7 patch notes that will be released on 6/6.

**\# Improvements Planned for after June 7th**

We have received your feedback regarding the following issues, and we plan to address them  
and make improvements as outlined below. We are planning to roll out these changes as quickly as possible,  
but as these changes will require additional development, we would like to ask for your understanding in our being unable to specify an exact date for their implementation at this time. However, individual changes among these that can be implemented quickly will be applied as soon as possible following a review of overall content balance. We will provide the details of the timeline for each of these changes through a future notification.

**1\. Changes to Hero Growth**

We have noticed an issue where team compositions become more stagnant the more gameplay progresses.  
This has the potential to not only negatively impact hero balance but also increase the difficulty of account progression.

In order to allow players to more easily raise a wider hero pool and access a greater variety of content,  
we plan to implement the following changes.  
**A.**   Increased income for growth-related resources  
       The daily entry limit for the Gold, EXP,  
       and Upgrade Stone farm dungeons will be slightly increased to alleviate their scarcity at a basic level,        and in order to promote growth after level 60, which can be demanding in terms of EXP and Upgrade Stone requirements,        the entry limit of limited-entry dungeons and the overall EXP gain in Hard difficulty will be increased.        This will also provide a slight increase to the availability of presents,         shortening the time required to acquire exclusive equipment.

**B.**    Decoupling Hero Levels and Upgrades  
         At present, due to max level being limited by Upgrade Stones,  
         hero growth can stall altogether when a hero reaches max level while the required Upgrade Stone dungeon is not available.             While the current relationship between skill enhancement and hero upgrades will be maintained,          we will be changing hero level requirements so that heroes will be able to reach level 100 regardless of upgrade status          given sufficient acquisition of EXP.          Following the changes above, upgrades will be carried out independently,           and hero growth resulting from upgrade level will be slightly increased. 

  **C.**    Hero Resource Recall  
           We will develop and implement a feature allowing players to recall resources spent on hero growth that they wish to undo.               This feature will likely come with a limit in its number of uses,  
           but a function to reset the growth of a hero (excluding transcendence)            and recall the resources spent will be provided by default for each account.

   **D:**    Other  
           We plan to slightly increase the availability of lower tier Skill Books that can be found through the Resource Shop  
           and Infinite Corridor.

**2\. Changes to Hero Balance**

 **i.**   We will be adjusting hero balance in order to resolve the issue of stagnating team compositions and to improve the utility of underused heroes. Furthermore, we plan to adjust the balance of Talismans that serve as the core of boss battle strategies.  
  

**ii.**   Should this process result in a nerf, we will be providing hero resource recall functionality at the same time,  
       and we will announce the details through an advance notice before proceeding with the changes.  
      Our intended goal is to increase the pool of viable heroes for each area of content,       and as our vision for the game remains to allow for the levelling and gearing of heroes of each element       to the requirements  respective to each area of content, we will do our best to avoid nerfs that may cause players concern.

 **iii.** Rather than carry out these changes in a rush, we plan to carefully look into repercussions these changes  
       may have in the game's overall combat.  
        Further more, we plan to continue with regular balance adjustments as part of our update schedule going forward.

 **iv.**  In the nearest future, this will happen in the form of buffs to 2 heroes whose utility has fallen greatly behind our expectations.

     1) **Rin**  
      Our initial intent was to allow players to take advantage of Rin's AoE attacks to easily progress through Story Mode  
       in the early game, and for her to become an effective main DPS against fire in the late game.        As her current performance is falling behind relative to expectations, we will be giving her a buff.

    2)  **Alice**  
    Our goal for Alice was for her to be hero whose moderate PvE performance would be made up for by  
     a stellar performance in PvP.     As her usage rates appear to be low due to issues with the Priority Gauge increase effect on her skill 2     and the activation chance of the effect on her exclusive equipment, we will be giving her a buff.

**3\. Changes to Monster Balance (Mechanics)**

 **i.**   We are aware of certain monster mechanics that can pose too high of a hurdle, and we will be making changes accordingly.

 **ii.**   As there is a sense of accomplishment in overcoming these hurdles,  
        we will be adjusting these mechanics to pose a more reasonable challenge rather than dial the difficulty down too far.

 **iii**.   First, certain Bosses encountered during initial progression that are too difficult will have the difficulty of  
        their mechanics adjusted down (Area 6 Deckard / Area 10 Ksai / Demiurge Stella),  
        and in the Skyward Tower, bosses that become a hurdle for players, such as Sigma,        will have their difficulty re-evaluated and adjusted again.

**4.  Changes to Side Stories**

We have noticed an issue where players spend all of their side story entries through piece farming  
and become unable to view the story. Changes will be made so that side story entries will not be expended  
outside of dungeons where pieces can be collected.
