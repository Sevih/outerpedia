Hello, Masters!  
This is Moonsoo Hyun, the producer of OUTERPLANE.  
It's hard to believe it's already been half a year since I first greeted all of you, Masters. I am filled with gratitude to all the Masters who have played and cherished OUTERPLANEfrom the end of spring, through the hot summer, and into the beautiful fall.Today, we’re announcing details of ongoing improvements for the second half of the year and providing details about the half-year anniversary event.

**◈ Improvements Details**As mentioned in our previous Developer's Note,  
we have prioritized improving existing issues and inconveniences over adding new features.  
We believe that this approach is more important for both our current and future OUTERPLANE players. In line with this, we have been working on the following improvements based on feedback from many of our players.Many improvements, including those related to Arena, Guild, and Equipment Presets, were implemented with the 10/24 Update. Further improvements are scheduled to be introduced in the upcoming updates on 11/7 and 11/21. **1\. 10/24 Improvements**

1

Check-in Rewards

Adjustments and improvements will be made to the rewards for New / Veronica’s Recruitment Supply / Season 2 Check-In Rewards.  
 Improvements will be made to provide more recruitment and growth opportunities compared to the previous system. Additionally, we've made it possible to obtain Tio as a Day 1 Check-In reward, allowing you to go on adventures with her immediately.

11/7

2

Content Unlock Time Adjustment

Since the majority of content unlocking is concentrated in Area 3,  
which is causing a lack of information and disrupting early game progression,  
 we have decided to make adjustments and improvements to certain tutorial and content unlock times.

11/7

3

Area Clear Missions and Guide Quests

Adjustments will be made to Clear Missions in existing Season 1 Normal/Hard Areas  
: We plan to increase the unit mission intervals and adjust the rewards, allowing you to reset short-term goals by claiming rewards.  
Veronica, a versatile hero with both short-term and long-term utility, will replace Rhona as the distributed hero, improving usability.  As a result, guide quest pathways and rewards will be adjusted to reflect these changes.

11/7

4

Start Dash

After analyzing the complete dataset, we have observed that the Earth Hero, Noah, has an overwhelmingly high selection rate of 80%.  
We believe that this has a negative impact on the game's diversity and fun factor. As a result, we will be making adjustments.  
: While existing heroes have their own utility, we have noticed that their usefulness in adventure progression is lower than that of Noa. They lack universality. Therefore, we plan to make the following changes to all Start Dash heroes except Noa to ensure that early-game progression is smoother, regardless of which hero you choose.   - Current: Noa / Eliza / Laplace / Alice / Maxwell   - Expected: Noa / Valentine / Rin / Eternal

11/7

5

Base > Combat Calculation Module and Auto Combat

We believe that the Combat Calculation Module in Base for upgrading the Auto Combat feature is unnecessary and rather distracts the progress of the game. Therefore, this feature will be removed, and improvements will be made to provide the final Auto Combat feature when using Auto Combat. (Burst/Skill Chain and Battle Settings)
