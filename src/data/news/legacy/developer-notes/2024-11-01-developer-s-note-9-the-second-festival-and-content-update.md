Hello, Masters!  
This is Moonsoo Hyun, the producer of OUTERPLANE.  
It's been approximately 3 months since the previous Developer's Note.We'd like to offer our sincere apologies for the following news before informing you about the other updates. As we mentioned in the previous Developer's Note, we are currently developing new content and update specs, but it is taking more time than we had estimated because we are trying to showcase results of a higher quality. We would like to apologize for the delay and we will do our best to update it and reveal it as soon as possible. In this 9th Developer's Note, we would like to provide an overview onthe second OUTERPLANE Festival and the updates that will follow.

\- We will be releasing Gnosis Nella, a new Demiurge Hero, during this Festival.  
  Gnosis Nella possesses various debuffs that target all enemies  and is expected to show aptitude in PvP content through the "I Am the Sole Perfection" skill   that removes enemies' buffs and stuns them.  In addition, her high Chain Points supply, Weakness Gauge reduction, targeted cooldown increase,  and more will highlight her strength in PvE battle as well, making her a hero that can play a big role   in whichever deck you place her in.  Get ready to meet Gnosis Nella, the versatile hero that can be utilized in both PvE and PvP!**3.** **Story Event Dungeon "In the Great New World," "Automaton of a World Reversed" Update**\- "In the Great New World," which is a story set in a dark fantasy world ruled by Nella,  
  you will find 6★ Legendary Weapons and Accessories in the Event Shop, unlike before.   
  We hope you enjoy the story dungeon that will be available with Gnosis Nella's release on November 5th,   and we hope you equip her with the powerful gear optimized for her, including the adorable Chibi Monad Eva.  Furthermore, "Automaton of a World Reversed," which is a story centered around Epsilon and Vlada, will be updated on     November 19th and will provide various rewards. **4.** **New 3★ Heroes "Rey" and "Hilde"**  
\- Two new 3**★** heroes will be released during the Festival period.  
   Don't forget to check out Rey, the bright and friendly optimist, and Hilde, the shy battle maid.  
**5.** **Events during the Festival** **1) Recruitment Support Event to celebrate the release of Gnosis Nella**   
 - Alongside the beginning of the Festival on November 5th, we will be providing  
    users with Limited Recruitment Tickets worth 100 Festival recruitments    through the 7-Day Check-in Event, the Festival Web Event, Coupons, and more.    Make sure to participate in the events during the Festival and get your rewards.

 **2) Increased Duplicate Hero Pieces Event**

The exchange rate will be set at 1:1.5, reflecting the existing value.**\[Content Update and the addition of a Permanent Event\]**

**1.** **Content Update** 

 **1)** **Scheduled for 11/05 (Tue): **Expanded difficulty for Special Request: Ecology Study and Special Request: Identification,****  
      ****New Gear Enhancement System****   
\- To provide users with the sense of progression of an RPG and a new in-game goal,  
    we are expanding the difficulty of the Special Request dungeon to 13 stages.- Clear the dungeons by fighting the stronger Special Request bosses,    and upgrade your heroes that have been stuck by performing breakthrough on Armor and enhancing Exclusive Equipment/Talismans.    Regarding the enhancement of Exclusive Equipment, the updates will take place prioritizing the heroes that see more use,    and further details will be provided through a patch note in a future update.**2) **Scheduled for 11/19 (Tue):** Main Story Season 3 Area 1, 2 Update**  
\- The Story for Season 3 will be updated, as was mentioned in the previous Developer's Note.  
\-  We have previously mentioned that it would consist of 3 areas,     but the specs have decreased since our initial plan, so we will only be adding 2 Normal/Hard areas instead.    We would like to apologize for the change in plans.     We are still planning to continuously update 1 Story Area per month,     so we hope you keep an eye out for the regular Story Area updates.**3) ****Scheduled for December: **Upcoming Updates********  
\- New content \[Irregular Extermination\] will be added,  
  and there will be an overall renewal of \[Guild Raid\] and \[World Boss\].   Further details will be provided through a future patch note.**2\. New Permanent Event**  
 **1) Scheduled for 11/5 (Tue): Special Request Permanent Event**  
\-  According to data, we've deduced that many Masters have been struggling to  
   clear the Special Request Dungeons Stage 8 and higher.    A new permanent event will be added to lower the entry barrier of Special Requests    to make it easier for users to farm gear and enjoy the content to its fullest.    The event will be available when the Special Request content is released,    and we are planning to create simple missions through which you can gain gear and growth resources,    as well as 3☆ Earth, Water, and Fire Heroes that will help you clear the Special Request Dungeons.    This event will be added on top of the Special Request dungeon difficulty expansion,    so we hope that existing Masters can aim for a new goal, while new Masters can aim for    completing the dungeon.

 

**\[Improvements\]**

**1\. Quality of Life Improvements**  
 **1) Scheduled for 11/19 (Tue): Lowered difficulty for Adventure License Quirk Enhancement**  
\- We are planning to lower the points required to purchase Proof of Worth from the Adventure License Shop  
   from 500 License Points to 125 License Points per purchase in order to allow more Masters to enhance their License Quirks.   Masters that have made purchases before this change will be sent the difference via mail.   We will provide more information about the points that are to be sent through a separate notice or a maintenance notice.

Whenever we reach out with these Developer's Notes, we can't help but think that we have  
much more to prove to match the incredible amount of love and support we receive from the Masters.  
That is why reaching this 1.5-year anniversary with the Masters means so much to us. We have no doubt that it was only possible due to the Masters that have been supporting us throughout the whole ride. We hope you thoroughly enjoy yourselves in this second festival that we've prepared to reciprocate the abundance of love and support you send our way.
