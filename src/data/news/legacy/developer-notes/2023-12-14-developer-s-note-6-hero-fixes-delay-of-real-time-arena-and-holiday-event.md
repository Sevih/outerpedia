Hello, Masters!  
This is Moonsoo Hyun, the producer of OUTERPLANE.  
 It's already December, marking the end of the year. During this chilly season, we would like to extend well wishes for your well-being and hope that your days are filled with warmth.   Today, we present the 6th Developer Note, addressing the details of the hero balancing adjustment,  the schedule delay of Real-Time Arena and holiday event details.

**\# Hero Balance Adjustments**  
Following the Demiurge Drakhan update, many of our Masters expressed concerns about the new hero's performance falling short compared to the acquisition and growth difficulty.  
We apologize for not meeting satisfaction in terms of the new hero's performance balance. Based on your feedback, internal reviews have confirmed some hero balance adjustments, including Demiurge Drakhan. While detailed specifics may undergo fine-tuning according to internal simulation results, we plan to maintain the balancing direction as follows:

**\[Will be implemented following the Update on 12/19/23 (Tue)\]**

**◈ Demiurge Drakhan**  
We have determined that her overall performance is limited  
before reaching 6-star transcendence, making it challenging to utilize her effectively after recruitment. To address this, we plan to adjust her balance as follows:   **1)** We will redistribute the effects of transcendence and add an effect that lets her take reduced damage  
        from attacks that target all enemies. This adjustment aims to provide a more noticeable increase in  
        performance upon recruitment and growth through each transcendence.

  **2)** Skill 2: An additional penetration buff will be added to enhance the overall damage dealing capabilities of both the caster  
       and allies through improvements to her Skill 2, Doom Heralding Cry.  
With these adjustments, we aim to enhance her ally protection abilities and introduce a buffer role, addressing her deficiencies as a Defender and making her more versatile in both PVE and PVP.

**\[Will be implemented following the Update on 1/2/24 (Tue)\]**

**◈ Ame**  
Ame's damage-dealing abilities, particularly before equipping her Exclusive Equipment,  
will be enhanced to solidify her position as a damage dealer suitable for various content.

  **1)** Mikazuki 1st Art: Blooming and Burst Skill - Sakura, Chiru will be changed to an attack that targets all enemies upon  
        acquisition, with increased damage dealt to an advantageous element and a granted Attack buff when attacking.    
        The Burst Skill will permanently apply as an attack that targets all enemies.

  **2)** Mikazuki 2nd Art: Pruning – The effect of increased damage dealt to bosses, originally from her Exclusive Equipment,  
       will be added to her passive effect, combined with the existing critical rate effect.

  **3)** Mikazuki 3rd Art: Flower Charm - The conditions for triggering the Sakura, Chiru/Ume Ichirin buffs will be adjusted,  
        allowing for a quicker acquisition of the Ume Ichirin buff specialized for attacking with a single attack.

  **4)** Exclusive Equipment: The effect will be changed to increase damage dealt to Water enemies.  
  
We look forward to your support for Ame, who now possesses a conditional attack targeting all enemies, enhanced damage-dealing abilities, and faster Ume Ichirin buff acquisition.

**◈ Sterope**  
Sterope, identified as the least frequently used hero, will undergo a significant adjustment due to factors such as PVP balance  
changes that diminished the value of Accuracy and Effectiveness. In response, Skill 3 – “Fight Ferociously!” will see substantial adjustments for overall improvement. The unique buff of Skill 2, 'Keraunos,' will be removed, and in its place, the Unhealable effect will be granted as a battle entry passive and an additional effect of Skill 3. These adjustments aim to make Sterope more versatile, allowing her to be used in various situations compared to her current state with the newly added utility effect.This adjustment aims to improve usability in dungeons requiring the Unhealable effect and Earth/Light raids, while also exerting a strong impact on certain PVP team compositions. We hope you anticipate these forthcoming adjustments.

**\# The Delay in the Real-Time Arena Schedule**

To provide our Masters with a higher-quality experience,  
we have regrettably postponed the release of the Real-Time Arena, initially planned for the last update of 2023.  
We sincerely apologize to our Masters who have awaited the Real-Time Arena content. We want to assure you that we are committed to delivering content that meets your satisfaction. The updated schedule will be announced at a later date, and we will make every effort to release it as soon as possible.Your understanding is greatly appreciated. 

**\# holidays Event Details**
