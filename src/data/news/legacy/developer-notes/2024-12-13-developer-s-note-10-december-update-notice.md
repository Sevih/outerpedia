\- The following quality of life improvements will be implemented.  
   ㄴWhen performing a breakthrough for gear, you will now be able to check gear details and unlock it  
        by long tapping on the right side of the screen.    ㄴ A lock/unlock feature will be added to gear that is being dismantled or sold.    ㄴ Sweep All button will be added to the Memorial Match sweep function, eliminating the need for individual selections.   ㄴ A feature will be added to directly apply the team formation of other Masters for dungeons that provide clear info.    (\* Please note that non-owned heroes are excluded from the changes.)   ㄴ The search guide pop-up in the lobby will be improved to allow checking all at once. ㄴYou will now be able to obtain rewards          from the Antiparticle Generator in the lobby without entering the Base.    ㄴ A winning streak system will be added to the Arena, and the equipped gear in the Arena Shop will be revamped.**\[Demiurge Mission and Recruitment Event Changes\]**

\- To enhance your enjoyment of the long-running/recurring Demiurge Mission event,  
   the following changes will be made after the 12/31 update.

\-  Adjustments  
ㄴ(**Old**) Obtain event currency (Call of the Ruler) through three missions  
ㄴ(**New**) Demiurge recruitment will be available for free once per day

Even with free Demiurge recruitment, Demiurge mileage will accumulate just like with default recruitment,  
so it is expected that you will be able to obtain your desired heroes more reliably than before.

Additionally, the Recruitment Tickets from the new Master 3-day check-in event and the area clear events  
will also be changed to mileage-accumulating tickets.  
We kindly ask for your understanding regarding these changes, as they are intended to provide more stable service and better benefits in the future.
