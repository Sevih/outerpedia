Monad Gate features roguelike elements.   Travel through a parallel version of Mirsha with Eva and work to restore the twisted timeline to its original state. Unlike the previous endgame content, it is being developed with a lower difficulty level that all Masters can enjoy. We're working hard on balancing and development to ensure that Masters of all levels can have fun, so we hope you're looking forward to it!

: As part of the April 22 update, the difficulty of the Irregular Infiltration Operation was reduced, and rewards for both Irregular Cell and the Terminus Isle were increased. In addition, features such as Pursuit Operation Sweep and other improvements are scheduled to be added in July.Finally, in response to feedback from many Masters, features such as "Reforge All" and "Enhance All" will be added in July to make Gear Reforge and Skill Enhance more convenient, alongside the previously requested inventory expansion.(\* Content and improvement schedules are subject to change depending on the development status.)
