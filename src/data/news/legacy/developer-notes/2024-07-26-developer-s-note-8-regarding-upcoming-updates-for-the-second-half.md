Hello, Masters!  
This is Moonsoo Hyun, the producer of OUTERPLANE.  
First, we would like to sincerely apologize for any concerns and uncertainties caused by the seasonal limited pickup content introduced in the 7/16 (Tue) update. We are carefully reviewing each valuable opinion sent in and conducting in-depth discussions based on these insights to identify and improve potential areas. Rest assured, we will do our best to implement the necessary changes. In this 8th Developer's Note, we would like to share our plans for the second half of 2024. We are working diligently to develop and update various new content and events. Here is a brief introduction to the content we are preparing along with the expected schedule. 

* * *

**\[Planned Updates for the Second Half of the Year\]**

**1\. Content Update Direction**

When you visit OUTERPLANE, we believe it’s essential to always have something worthwhile available.  
To achieve this, we are focusing on developing new content and regular events, dividing our efforts into these two main categories.  
**1) New Content** \- We have alleviated growth difficulties through the introduction of Quirks and Precise Craft,  
  resulting in an overall increase in the specs of our Masters.  
  As a result, high-difficulty content such as Weapon/Armor Raid Dungeons, Guild Raids, and World Boss encounters   have become generally easier to clear.   We are now entering a stage where it is challenging to maintain a sense of continuous growth and set new, challenging goals.  → Considering the current situation, we plan to adjust the overall content direction by adding higher-difficulty endgame content. This new content will be designed to offer simple challenges and a sense of achievement on a weekly basis. Alongside the expansion of high-difficulty new content, please note that the difficulty levels and rewards of Currency Dungeons will also be adjusted to increase the basic growth rate.

**2) Regular Events**  
\-  We are preparing to continuously offer various events centered around Seasonal Events featuring limited-time seasonal heroes and OUTERPLANE Festival events with exclusive festival heroes.  
Our goal is to ensure you have a fun and engaging experience while playing.

→ The first OUTERPLANE Festival is scheduled to take place from the end of July to the end of August,  
lasting approximately 4 weeks.  
 Starting with this festival event, we will do our utmost to provide a variety of rewards and enjoyable experiences.

  
**2\. Planned Events for the Second Half of the Year**  
*※ Please note that these improvements are currently under review and subject to change.*   
  
**1) OUTERPLANE Festival**  
\- Every 2 to 3 months, a regular event called OUTERPLANE Festival will be held, featuring a variety of rewards.  
  :  New Demiurge-level heroes will be added, and the rewards for duplicate pickups will be increased.      Additionally, various rewards will be provided based on event equipment acquisition.

\- The first festival will begin on 7/30 (Tue).  
  : With the addition of the new hero Gnosis Dahlia, we plan to offer rich rewards of Limited Recruitment Tickets and  
    Ether up to 100 recruits during the event period to support your acquisition of new hero.Previously purchased (paid) Call of the Demiurge items will be exchangeable for Limited Recruitment Tickets during the festival period and will be added to the Currency Shop.

The exchange rate will be set at 1:1.5, reflecting the existing value.

Additionally, during the OUTERPLANE Festival, you can use Limited Recruitment Tickets alongside Ether.  
This allows you to acquire the new Demiurge-level character at a discounted price.

  
**2) Seasonal Events (Halloween/Christmas)****\-** While we conduct regular story events every month,  
  seasonal events are larger-scale events featuring limited heroes.  
  In the second half of 2024, we are preparing Halloween and Christmas events.   We will ensure that these events provide more rewards and benefits,     aiming to offer an enjoyable experience without the inconveniences seen in the summer events.

  
**3\. Upcoming New Content**   
*※ Please note that these improvements are currently under review and subject to change.*  
  
**1) Skyward Tower Revamp: Very Hard Difficulty and Synchro Room Added** : Scheduled for Late July to Early August \- The Hard difficulty of the Skyward Tower will be changed to a monthly rotation format, similar to the Normal difficulty.  
    Currently, the clear rewards for each floor will be transferred to the initial clear rewards.  
    After the initial clear, you will receive a new currency, Automaton Coin, for subsequent clears.    You will be able to use Automaton Coins to purchase various items in the newly available Skyward Tower exclusive shop.   This update is scheduled to be implemented on 7/30.    Please note that floors cleared before 7/30 will be marked as completed, and after the reset on 8/1, you will start receiving rewards for repeated clears.

Synchro Room  
:  With the addition of the Very Hard difficulty, we will implement improvements to facilitate entry and clearing of the existing Normal and Hard difficulties.  
  Notably, the Synchro Room system will be introduced to support clearing the Skyward Tower on Hard difficulty. :  It is a new feature in the Base that allows you to select 1-3 star heroes and achieve a certain level of growth without the need for additional growth currency. :  This system is expected to make clearing the Skyward Tower on Hard difficulty easier and will serve as a gateway to accessing the final difficulty, Very Hard.

  Quick Climb Feature   
:  - A Quick Climb feature will be added.  
:  This will help reduce the hassle of repetitive gameplay.

  
**2)** Adventurer License and Weekly Raid Missions : Scheduled for September  
\- This content, in a Boss Rush format, allows you to use unique Quirks    
exclusive to this mode to gradually challenge higher difficulty bosses. - In response to Adventurers' Guild Cindy’s request,   players can increase their adventurer level and attempt to upgrade their Adventurer License.   This content is designed to offer weekly goals and a sense of progression by defeating progressively harder bosses in stages. - This content is planned to offer high-grade gems, which are currently relatively difficult to obtain, and will provide various rewards beyond just gem farming.

  
**3) Irregular Extermination** : Scheduled for October  
\- This content, inspired by the prelude to Season 2’s Irregular enemies,  
  involves facing off against three types of Irregular Named bosses before taking on Irregular Queen Nadja in a joint operation/raid-style format. - It will reset at regular intervals and is being developed as a content option that can be enjoyed solo or with friends and guild members.

  
**4) Main Story Season 3** : Scheduled for November  
\- The first part of Season 3 is scheduled to be released in November.  
\- The first part consists of three areas and will focus on the story unfolding in Eseph, which is ruled by Iota, as many Masters have anticipated. - Following the initial update, as previously announced, new areas for Season 3 will be added every 1-2 months. We appreciate your continued interest and support.

**4\. Other Improvements**

\- **Filter Improvements**: To improve the usability of equipment and hero filters, we are adding new filters and adjusting the reset timing.  
\-  **Event Schedule  and Buff Visibility Improvements**: UI improvements will be made to enhance event remaining time and buff visibility

**2) Content Improvement**  
  Guild Raid  
: The guild raid battles, which have been repetitively patterned since their opening, will be prioritized for renewal.  
     ㄴ We plan to enhance the sense of teamwork among guild members by making the experience of defeating enemies more immersive. Additionally, we will address the issue where masters who have completed their growth always receive the same score with full gear. → After the renewal mentioned above, we will assess the status of guild raids for Masters on each server and decide whether to merge the raids. 

  Asynchronous Arena New Season  
: The new season of the arena, which has been operating as a pre-season due to various issues, is set to begin.  
: From 8/13 to 10/13, a new league called 'League of Glory' will take place. Throughout the league, from start to finish, players can earn various rewards, including Glunite and Legendary 6-star Lifesteal Set Armor, through the arena shop.:  After conducting one additional arena season, we will reevaluate the need to merge servers for the asynchronous arena.

In addition to the improvements mentioned above, we will make every effort to address any issues that Masters may encounter within our capacity.
