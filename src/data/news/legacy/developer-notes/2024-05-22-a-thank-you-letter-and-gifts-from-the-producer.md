Hello, Masters!  
This is Moonsoo Hyun, the producer of OUTERPLANE.OUTERPLANE, launched globally on May 23, 2023, is already celebrating its first anniversary.On behalf of the development team at OUTERPLANE, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to all the Masters who have loved and enjoyed OUTERPLANE over the past year.Time has flown by so quickly that it feels like just yesterday was May 23 of last year. Yet here we are, a year later.The excitement and nervousness of meeting Masters from around the world, the thrill of our initial launch amidst many worries, the disappointment I felt when our imperfections and mistakes let you down, and the satisfaction that came from resolving various issues through the feedback of our dedicated Masters—all of these experiences have been deeply impactful.The many joyful and challenging memories bring the past year back to me as I express my gratitude to you today.Being able to connect with so many Masters through OUTERPLANE has been a tremendous blessing for us.For this, we are truly grateful. Ultimately, it is your warm encouragement and thoughtful advice that have helped us create a better OUTERPLANE today.While there are still many areas within the game that need improvement, we will always listen to your feedback. Our team is committed to doing its best and continually improving so that you can enjoy OUTERPLANE for many years to come.
