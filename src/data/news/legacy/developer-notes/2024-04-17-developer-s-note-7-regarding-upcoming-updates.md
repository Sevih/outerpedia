Hello, Masters!  
This is Moonsoo Hyun, the producer of OUTERPLANE.  
Thank you as always for your continued interest and support for OUTERPLANE.First, I'd like to apologize to all our players who waited for the Developer's Note for being unable to reach out sooner. I'd also like to apologize for the inconvenience caused by stability issueswith the World Boss and other newly updated content. Our priorities were focused on providing a stable service to our players, and, as a result, we found it difficult at the time to provide communication regarding the direction of future updates. We'd like to ask for your kind understanding in this regard.In this 7th Developer's Note, we would like to provide you with details regarding the direction of future updates.

**\[Upcoming Updates\]**

**1\. Terminus Isle Exploration / Quirks / Precise Craft** 

We've received a lot of feedback from our players saying that there was insufficient routine content to enjoy after completing the story.

We prepared and carried out beta tests for the World Boss and Real-Time Arena content in order to address this issue, but the barrier to entry turned out to be a bit too high to be an effective solution for players still in the middle of progressing their accounts.

As such, we've decided that the addition of routine content that can also help players take on the upcoming World Boss and Real-Time Arena upon their full release is the highest-priority task currently facing OUTERPLANE, and so we will be making the following updates to provide fun new content for players to enjoy.  
   
 1) New Content: Terminus Isle Exploration

 *※ The image above is currently under development and is shown without multilingual support. It may be subject to change upon release.*  
  
\- On Terminus Isle, players can explore the island and clear events to obtain various rewards.    Players can access Terminus Isle after they've cleared at least one Special Request dungeon at Stage 8 or above.    Exploration progress is reset every Monday, and players will be able to select between 10 different difficulty levels depending    on their level of progress. Through Terminus Isle Exploration, players will be able to obtain resources used in the newly added 

  Quirk and Precise Craft systems, and they can also look forward to obtaining massive rewards by defeating the

  new boss  Ziggsaron, the Ravenous Wolf King, who appears at certain intervals during the Terminus Isle Exploration.

  
 2) Quirks

*※ The image above is currently under development and is shown without multilingual support. It may be subject to change upon release.*  
  
\-  Quirks are a new growth system that can be advanced using points acquired through the Terminus Isle content, 

     and have been designed to help players more easily challenge higher-difficulty content.       
     Through Quirks, players can enhance the stats of Heroes by element and class, and can upgrade stats that are effective  
     in progressing through PvE.

    Furthermore, players can also upgrade stats that help them throughout the game overall,  
    such as ones that enhance their resource acquisition or lower crafting costs.  
 3) Precise Craft

*※ The image above is currently under development and is shown without multilingual support. It may be subject to change upon release.*  
  
\-   Precise Craft can be accessed through the base, and it is intended to reduce the difficulty of obtaining Legendary gear.     It will consume resources obtained through Terminus Isle Exploration,     and players will be able to select the unique and main stats of a Legendary piece of gear,     and roll repeatedly for substats within certain bounds to craft gear with their desired stats.

**2\. World Boss Official Launch**  
Many players have sent us feedback during the first World Boss beta test  
that the content was difficult to enjoy for newer players. As such, we will be taking player feedback into account and dividing up difficulties and leaderboards so that players can take on World Bosses that match their progress. Please note that we will be working on these changes with a target launch date of late June to early July.     We are currently working on new World Bosses to reduce the potential fatigue of having to face the same World Boss month after month, and we are also working on World Boss-exclusive costume rewards  to provide players with an additional incentive to take on the challenge.

Please note that we may hold another World Boss beta test prior to its official launch  
to test the aforementioned changes.

**3\. Main Story Update**

I would first like to apologize for not being able to bring you the main story update sooner  
due to the work on it taking longer than expected.  
We will be bringing you the new installment of the main story, Season 2 Part 2, on the 21st of May, and we hope you will be able to enjoy it as much as possible. Also, in order to reduce the likelihood of another such extended hiatus between story updates, we are planning to bring you future story content on a regular schedule. Starting with Season 3, we are hoping to release at least 1 new area every 1 to 2 months following the initial story update. While the scale of each individual update will be smaller, we are hoping this will help reduce the size of the gap between story releases. As story content takes a lot of time and resources to produce, we are unable to provide a specific date for the release of Season 3 at this time. We ask for your kind understanding, and we will do our best to bring it to you as soon as possible.

**4\. Quality of Life Improvements**  
We have reviewed the feedback our players have provided through various channels,  
 and we are working to address them via various quality of life improvements.

We have added a sweep function to the equipment dungeon,  
and we are planning to add a sweep function to Memorial Match in the Arena.  
Also, we are hoping to soon unveil the Ultimate Skill (Skill 3) skip function that was delayed due to the large amounts of systematic improvements that had to happen in order for it to be implemented. We plan to continue making improvements to the game based on the feedback provided to us by our players, and we will do our best to provide our players with an enjoyable experience through a stable service and engaging gameplay.
