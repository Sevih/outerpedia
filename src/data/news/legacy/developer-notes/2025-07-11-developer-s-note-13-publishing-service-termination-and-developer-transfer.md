Hello. Masters!This is Moonsoo Hyun, the producer of OUTERPLANE.Following our greeting in the Developer’s Note for the 2nd anniversary update, we are back with news for the first time in about two months. While there were certainly areas that could have been improved,we sincerely hope our Masters enjoyed the events and content we had prepared.Today, we would like to share some important news regarding changes to the future direction of our service operations.

**\[Publishing Service Termination and Developer Transfer\]**  
**1\. Publishing Service Termination**  
Thanks to the collaboration with our publisher, Smilegate,  
and the unwavering support from our Masters, we have been able to providea stable service as OUTERPLANE has continued to grow, step by step.We would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank everyone who has been with us on this journey.Starting on September 23, 2025, service operations will be transferredfrom Smilegate to VAGames, the game’s developer.While this news may come as a surprise,this decision was made after close and careful discussions with Smilegate.To pursue new challenges and directions, the development team has decided to take over direct service of the game.As the developer, we will move forward with an even stronger sense of responsibility and do our utmost to deliver an even better gameplay experience in OUTERPLANE.If you choose to join us on this new journey following the service transfer,we promise to repay your support with an even more refined and rewarding version of OUTERPLANE.

**2\. Developer Service Transfer**  
Due to the change in service provider, Masters who wish to continue playing the game  
will need to complete the transfer process via the in-game “Service Transfer” feature, which will be added in a future update.The transfer process is outlined below, and further details will be provided at the time of the update. 

  
1) When you log into the game lobby, a “Service Transfer” banner will appear on the screen.  
You can tap this banner to access the transfer screen.(This screen can also be accessed through the in-game settings.)2) Please review the information on the Service Transfer screen and complete the consent process.3) Once you have given your consent, a transfer code will be issued automatically.You may take a screenshot of the code or send it to your email. Please note that the code can only be sent once.4) After the service transfer, enter the transfer code on the login screen of the new version of the game.This will link your existing account information, allowing you to continue your gameplay seamlessly. 

**\* The transfer code can also be entered via \[Settings → Account\] in the game.**

  

  
Transfer applications will only be accepted during the designated period.  
Masters who complete the transfer during this time will receive a Selection Ticket that lets you choose a Demiurge hero, along with various other rewards and benefits.Please make sure to complete the process on time.

  
Even after the application period has ended, we are considering offering temporary support for transfers  
and gameplay through alternative methods.However, if you do not complete the transfer within the designated period, your access to the game may be restricted. We therefore strongly recommend completing the transfer on time.**\* For more information about the transfer,**  
   **please refer to the** [**\[▶ Advance Notice of OUTERPLANE Service Transfer ◀\]**](https://page.onstove.com/outerplane/en/view/10859678)**.**

will automatically continue playing on the Global 2 server.We will strive to provide a stable gameplay experience.Your existing data will remain safe after the merge, butsome Dungeon Clear Info and previously saved ranking records may be reset.We will do our best to minimize confusion and ensure smooth gameplay.We kindly ask for your understanding regarding any unexpected issues that may arise.

**4\. Future Development and Update Plans**  
We believe that this service transfer is not the end of change, but rather the beginning of a new chapter.  
Our development team remains committed to the ongoing improvement and expansion of OUTERPLANE.That said, our top priority is to ensure service stability after the transfer.To that end, we plan to adjust the update schedule leading up to the transfer,and kindly ask for your understanding that some updates originally planned through September may be rescheduled.**1) Before the Service Transfer**  
The summer event, long anticipated by many of our Masters, was originally planned for mid-July.  
However, we are now considering holding it after the service transfer.That said, the Swimsuit Costumes for Kanon and Ame, originally plannedfor the summer event, will be added first through the July and August Battle Passes.Season 3’s main story is set to conclude in Area 9, and we aim to release this updatein August to ensure it can be completed before the service transfer.In addition, two new heroes are planned for release before the service transfer.However, please note that this schedule may change depending on the transfer timeline.Since ensuring service stability is our top priority, program updates, improvements, and new content additions will be kept to a minimum until the transfer is complete.**2) After the Service Transfer**  
Through this service transfer, we aim to go beyond a simple operational change and  
take this opportunity to further elevate the game’s core enjoyment and overall quality.Following the transfer, more than six new heroes, already planned through early 2026, will be gradually added.We also plan to enhance and expand various content based on feedback from our Masters.In addition, with new content and improvements to the growth system, OUTERPLANE will gradually evolve into a more PvE-focused RPG.Building on this direction, we will continue to steadily develop the game, and we hope for your continued interest and support.To summarize our key post-transfer plans:

  
1\. Ongoing regular updates and development of new content

2\. Balance adjustments and UI/UX improvements based on player feedback

3\. Focus on ensuring a stable operating environment and enhancing service quality

4\. Special rewards and events planned to commemorate the service transfer

**5\. Closing Remarks**

But one thing is certain.OUTERPLANE’s journey is not coming to an end. It’s a new beginning as we venture into an even more expansive world.with greater responsibility and sincerity, doing our utmost to deliver an even better gameplay experience.To show our appreciation for the support you have given us, we have prepared a special thank-you giftfor all Masters who complete the transfer process, so you can begin this new journey with even more excitement.We sincerely hope you’ll continue your adventure with us,as we journey deeper into our otherworld travels.
