**The Action Anime, OUTERPLANE**

**Hello, this is OUTERPLANE.**

We gathered together frequently asked questions from our community

and gave them to our director to answer.

Please take a moment to check out our down-to-earth Q&A! :-)

**Q1. Do you have plans for a real-time arena, and if you do, when will it be implemented?**

We are currently in the process of developing a real-time arena, and we have plans to implement it in-game. However, we hope you understand that it is difficult for us to pin down an exact date for its implementation at this time.

Our number one priority at the time of the global launch is to support our players so that they are able to achieve a steady sense of growth and settle into the game through game modes such as story mode and raid dungeons.

As the real-time arena is being prepared to be a part of endgame content, we plan to introduce it after taking player progression and statistics into account. Once the time frame of its implementation has been decided, we will announce the specifics through updates and notices.

**Q2. Will the global launch take place through the addition of new languages and servers to the existing version?**

**Also, will we be able to freely select our servers after the launch?** 

Yes, the global launch will come in the form of new servers being added and new languages being supported.

Japanese voices will be added in the global version, and text translations will be available in Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese, along with English which is already in the game.

**Q3. Will we be able to freely select our servers after the launch?**

Yes, you will be able to select your server.

**Q4. Do you have plans to release a PC version, and if so, what will its system requirements be?**

We are currently planning to expand to the PC platform through Google Play Games. 

We are aiming for its implementation within the month of June, and we will soon announce the details through a notice.

**Q5. Why is there a limit on Stamina purchases when the game puts so much emphasis on gear farming?**

Analyzing other similar turn-based games with respect to new player experience and service longevity has led us to the conclusion that the factor most responsible for the continuously widening gap in power between users was a system that allowed for gear farming with no limit to Stamina.

That is why we decided to put a limit on Stamina in OUTERPLANE so that players can enjoy the game more casually in comparison to other games. 

However, the limit on Stamina purchases is up for change depending on what players find more enjoyable once the game has officially launched. 

If any changes do occur in the future, we will disclose the details in advance through an announcement.

**Q6. How is OUTERPLANE different from other turn-based RPGs?** 

**We know that the Speed stat also exists in OUTERPLANE. Does that mean OUTERPLANE will be another game where the fastest person always comes out on top?** 

Yes, the Speed stat also exists in OUTERPLANE. In many turn-based games, Speed holds the position of a highly important and versatile stat. In order to lower the dependence on Speed in PvP, OUTERPLANE has placed its focus on Accuracy and Evasion. 

In the early game, it will be possible to use the Speed stat to gain the upper hand in PvP, but as time progresses, we expect players to be able to overcome the Speed stat through the use of Accuracy and Evasion sets, as well as by utilizing various team compositions and mechanics such as Counterattack and Revenge. Additionally, we will continuously monitor PvP statistics so that various team compositions and strategies become viable.

**Q7.** **There have been complaints from users who have played the build launched in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines regarding the difficulty of acquiring growth materials.**

**They found raising star levels to be especially difficult, which resulted in the gameplay feeling slow. How do you plan to address this issue?** 

We understand that this question is related to Hero Piece farming. 

Our data suggests that it takes three months to fully transcend 3 Star Heroes, 45 days for 2 Star Heroes, and one month for 1 Star Heroes.

This might seem like an appropriate amount of time to some, while it might seem too long to others.

At present, Hero Pieces can be farmed by playing Side Stories. Players can also transcend Heroes by using Ether obtained while playing or by using duplicate pulls from Recruitment.

In addition to this, we plan to regularly produce and release a variety of events and event dungeons. We plan to provide an opportunity for players to obtain certain Hero Pieces more easily through such content, and we will continue to hold discussions regarding the most suitable approach based on player opinion and the status of live operations.

**Q8. Will there be pity?**

The pity is set to 200 pulls.

**Q9, There has been a lot of talk regarding the use of illegal programs. How do you plan to respond to this issue?**

Ever since the game's launch in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines, we have continued to ban accounts that made use of illegal programs and have posted notices in this regard. 

Once the usage of illegal programs is identified, we first make a record of the relevant data then proceed with administrative action after additional investigation. 

Please note that we adhere to the steps outlined previously as immediate administrative action without the saving of records leaves open the possibility for the users of illegal programs to abuse the system. We will continue to do our best to ensure that players can enjoy OUTERPLANE in a pleasant environment.

**Q10. Will there be pets?**

Currently, we have no plans to add pet-related systems. 

However, we do have plans to provide a system where players can obtain SD characters through event dungeons. 

At the moment, players have the ability to use Heroes they've obtained to decorate their lobbies. We are currently developing a feature that will allow players to use the SD characters they collect to decorate their lobbies as well.

**Q11. I would like to hear your honest opinion regarding the criticism that the 3D cut scenes look unnatural.**

As gamers first, we are well aware of the areas of our game that fall short and we are doing all that we can to remedy them.

We are also making efforts to improve our capabilities and pursue the path to a more polished game.

Specifically, we are in the process of recruiting additional talent and devoting more of our resources towards improving the game's quality.

As a company that places emphasis on in-game action and its presentation, VAGAMES aims to leverage its strengths to bring to life elements that are not easily found in other turn-based games. 

We are confident that the players will share our enthusiasm in this regard.

We have received a lot of feedback and requests regarding the Ultimate animations during the CBT, and we agree with them.

We will try our best to overturn these reactions and ensure that OUTERPLANE can match other recently-released games. We won't let you down :-)

**Q12. A lot of high-quality games have come out recently. What unique strengths does OUTERPLANE have to offer that make it stand out in such a competitive market?** 

We do think that we have lost a small portion of our competitive edge compared to when we first began developing the game,

but we firmly believe we possess a unique charm of our own.

Since OUTERPLANE is a game with its roots in the subculture genre, we recognize the importance of its story and the narrative of its characters. 

As such, we believe our strength lies in the foundation that we have built that allows for the seasonal release of stories with a clear and complete scope.

We will ensure that the stories do not take too long to play out and that they are not dragged out to the point where players become unable to recall past narratives.

Additionally, since OUTERPLANE is a turn-based strategy game, our developers have invested many hours in ensuring that monsters come with diverse patterns, 

and that players have the opportunity to feel a sense of accomplishment through the building of optimized team compositions to challenge them. We believe this provides us with a sufficient competitive edge.

We believe that the continued development of our unique battle systems and strategic elements will allow OUTERPLANE to possess a charm not seen in competing titles.

**Q13. Many of the prominent games support full dubs. Do you have plans to fully dub OUTERPLANE in the future?**

Currently, we have no plans to fully dub the game.

In our past experience, fully dubbing a game has been a major cause of content update delays. For now, we will be focusing our internal resources on ensuring the game successfully finds its feet, and we will consider introducing full dubbing in the future taking into consideration the state of the game's live operations.

**Q14.** **It felt like there was a lot of effort put into the cutscenes and modeling of 2 Star Heroes.**

**How much content will we be able to enjoy while exclusively using lower-star Heroes?**

**Or will the game be only playable with a party of 3 Star Heroes?** 

While we can't say going forward that they will be able to completely replace 3 Star Heroes, 

in the current version, it is entirely possible to clear endgame content by investing in 2 Star Heroes which require comparatively fewer resources.

Personally, I use 2 Star Dolly in the majority of content, 2 Stars Sofia and Marian in the Fire Element Armor Raid up to Stage 10, and 2 Star Vera as an exclusive DPS in The Archdemon's Ruins. 2 Star Iris and Parti have excellent synergy with each other and are more than capable of fulfilling main/sub DPS roles.

Other than that, certain 2 Star characters can act as counters to certain kinds of bosses, which means that investing in these characters can allow players to negate certain mechanics or provide stability in those encounters.

**Q15. How much time will players have to invest daily into playing OUTERPLANE?**

Once you've advanced to a certain point with in-game progress and Hero growth, you will be able to finish your daily routine within 30 minutes.

To help with this, the number of Clear Tickets provided by your Base will increase according to your Player Level.

That said, we will also be providing support for players who wish to enjoy more gameplay.

**Q16. If Heroes only acquire bonuses in a team with Heroes of the same element,** 

**then there seems to be no merit to using Heroes whose elements are different from each other. How do you plan on handling this issue in the future?** 

Content such as raids are designed to be tackled with single-element compositions, whereas in PvP, more focus will be put on the skill effects, rather than the elements, of the Heroes that make up the team.

**Q17. I think the game would be much more enjoyable if the maximum Stamina was about 180.**

The maximum level is currently set to 50. This will be gradually increased over the course of live operations. 

Maximum Stamina is planned to be increased accordingly.

**Q18. Do you plan to release character merch in the future?** 

We do have plans to release merch for sale,

and we're preparing to make them available through the Smilegate Shop.

**Q19. Do characters—whether they be allies or enemies—become slower when they take hits?**

No, they do not. However, certain Heroes and monsters can inflict debuffs that decrease speed and use skills that immediately decrease the Priority Gauge,

so getting hit by these skill effects can end up delaying your turn.

**Q20. Do you have plans to release skins for Heroes in the future?**

We do. They will be made available through various means such as through Battle Pass rewards and event dungeon rewards, among others.

We'll continue working hard to make OUTERPLANE a memorable and enjoyable experience for everyone.

Thank you.
