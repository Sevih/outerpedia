Hello, Masters!  
This is Moonsoo Hyun, the producer of OUTERPLANE.  
This marks our first greetings in the year 2025 for our Masters.  We sincerely wish you a healthy and happy year ahead. Our OUTERPLANE development team has been analyzing play data and feedback from our Masters in 2024 to explore ways to provide even better experiences and enjoyment in 2025.Contrary to our predictions, we've found that certain areas caused discomfort for Masters, and there were discrepancies between the most used content and actual participation, so we are working on how to address these issues. We are also considering how to offer new and enjoyable content for those who have been playing OUTERPLANE long term.First, to ensure that long time OUTERPLANE Masters do not experience inconvenience or fatigue from the game, we will continue making improvements to convenience, and based on the data we've gathered, we aim to develop future systems/content in a way that allows more Masters to enjoy the game.Regarding the previously mentioned new content, Monad Gate, we would like to sincerely apologize for not being able to release it as promised due to the need to refine it based on the data from the newly introduced and improved content. We will work to release it at a later date with enhanced quality. Today, we've prepared a developer's note to share information about the planned improvements for the first quarter of 2025.

**\[Guild Raid and World Boss Improvements\]**

**1) Guild Raid**  
While the Guild Raid has been running in its existing format for over a year,  
two main issues were identified through feedback from Masters and actual play data.The first issue is that new Masters are confused about whether to focus on the main boss or the sub-boss. The second issue is that the overall difficulty has been too high for new Masters, and too low for those who have already progressed fully, creating an imbalance. In particular, once Masters had progressed to a certain level, they could fix all of their Geas to red and achieve maximum scores, which reduced the differentiation in scores and made the content feel more like a chore.To address these problems, we carried out the first phase of improving the Guild Raid, and after the changes, we saw an increase in participation compared to before.However, there were still areas that needed further adjustment, so we will continue to refine the balance and improve the Geas system based on play data after improvements.**2) World Boss**  
The World Boss, initially planned as endgame content, faced an issue of low participation, which was contrary to our expectations. The main causes were the pressure of needing to invest in 12 heroes and the loss of interest  
when players used under-leveled heroes, leading to rank drops.To address these issues, we lowered the entry difficulty in lower leagues by adjusting the supporter damage and making players face only one boss at a time. Additionally, by offering the experience of being ranked 1st in the lower league after defeating a boss and providing rewards immediately upon clearing the league, we aimed to increase motivation to play.With these improvements, we've confirmed that the entry barrier for the content has lowered, and participation has increased. This approach will be applied to future rotating World Boss content as well. Furthermore, to offer new goals to existing owners, a new costume will be added soon. We appreciate your continued interest.

  
**\[Planned Improvements for the First Half of the Year\]**

Improvements, such as the Terminus Isle sweep feature and the Antiparticle Generator lobby rewards,  
have already been partially implemented.  
Additionally, other improvements, including the following items, will be gradually updated.**1) Removal of Clear Tickets**   
The current system lacks quantity for new Masters, hindering smooth gameplay,  
while long term players are left with largely useless Clear Tickets. As a result, we plan to remove Clear Tickets. In the future, sweeps will only require stamina, and any Clear Tickets you currently own can be exchanged for gold.**2) Hero Transcendence Revamp**  
To complement the piece farming and short term goal of transcending through the Doppelgänger dungeon,  
an intermediate transcendence stage will be added between the 5★ and 6★ transcendence processes. This change will allow for gradual stat increases throughout the transcendence process. While the final stats for the 6★ transcendence will remain unchanged, once you collect at least one hero's worth (150 pieces), their stats will continue to increase to ensure there are no balance concerns.**3) Hero Recruitment Revamp**  
The \[Custom Recruitment\], which was previously offered through past events,  
will now be added to replace \[Normal Recruitment\]. This improvement will make it easier for players to recruit their desired heroes compared to before.**4) Auto Dismantle Gear Added**  
The feature that automatically dismantles gear below a set quality will be updated.  
**5) Guide Quest Improvements**  
Overall UI improvements will be made to enhance visibility,  
and some missions will be adjusted to provide a better guide quest experience. **6) Challenge! Special Request: (Ecology Study/Identification) Event Improvements**  
The difficulty of missions for milestone rewards will be slightly lowered.  
**7) Currency Dungeon New Difficulty Added**  
The previously announced expansion of the currency dungeon difficulty,  
which has been pushed back due to prioritization, will be implemented to improve resource gain.**8) Guild Security Area Improvements**  
The maximum level will increase based on the Master's progression,  
while the daily challenge attempts will decrease to once per day. As a result, more rewards can be obtained with fewer attempts.**9) Regarding Stamina Restoration**  
There have been numerous complaints from monthly subscription Masters  
regarding the inconvenience of having to recharge stamina 10 times in a row. This feature will be removed and improved. **10) Regarding Terminus Isle**  
The currency required to change the weather will be changed from Ether to Gold,  
and monthly subscription owners will be able to select the weather.Additionally, the drop rates for Effectium/Quirk currency will slightly increase.

  
**\[Gnosis Dahlia Return Notice\]**

\- In 2025, the beloved \[Gnosis Dahlia\] will return from 1/24/25 — 2/11/25.   
   Please look forward to the \[Moment Ring: The Eternal Preserver\] event dungeon that comes with the return of \[Gnosis Dahlia\].  

  
**\[OUTER Reward Board Event Added****\]**

\- For 2025, a new event format will be added.  
   The \[OUTER Reward Board\] is an event where players can exchange reward points  
   earned by playing \[Adventure/Event Dungeon Hard Mode\] or \[Special Request Stage 8 or higher\] for milestone rewards.   Various rewards will be available, including 3★ \[Regina\] and \[Caren\] pieces, \[Limited Recruitment Tickets\],    and \[Special Recruitment Tickets\], so please look forward to it.
