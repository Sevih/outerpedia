Dear Masters,

Following the maintenance on December 16th (Tue), several issues have been identified, including  
an issue where, when an ally attacks while Mystic Sage Ame’s unique buff “Mandala” is active and the Mandala effect is triggered, the attacking ally’s buffs and debuffs are reduced by an additional turn.

We are currently investigating these issues. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the delay in resolving this matter, which has taken longer than initially expected.

\[Compensation Details\]

-   Limited Recruitment Tickets x10

\[Distribution Schedule\]

-   December 23 (Tue), 02:00 UTC

\[Claim Period\]

-   December 23 (Tue), 02:00 UTC ~ December 30 (Tue), 02:00 UTC

We apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused and truly appreciate your understanding.

We will continue to do our best to provide a stable and enjoyable service.

Thank you.
