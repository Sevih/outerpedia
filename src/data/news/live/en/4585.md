**10\. Other Improvements & Changes**

– Core-Fused Veronica can now equip Veronica’s existing costumes.  
– If the Light/Dark Hero Selector or certain Hero-Exclusive Oath Vows cannot be used, they can now be sold.

– Fixed an issue where, when Ultimate animations were set to Skip, using Core-Fused Veronica’s Ultimate would display the pre–Core Fusion Veronica illustration.

**11\. Bug Fixes**

– Fixed an issue where the Masterwork Enhancement Tool button did not appear on the Special Gear Enhancement screen when the player had 0 tools.  
– Fixed an issue where, under certain conditions, the Skill Tome and Evolution Stone synthesis buttons were not displayed.  
– Fixed an issue where, during Continuous Refinement, refinement-related missions appeared to progress only once.  
– Fixed an issue where Hero Stars did not display and Hero Levels appeared incorrectly in Friend Profiles, the \[Support\] screen, and the Arena screen.  
– Fixed an issue where, after setting Veronica as the Profile Hero and then performing Core Fusion, some content continued to display the pre–Core Fusion Veronica profile.  
– Fixed an issue where, for certain accounts, tapping the shortcut for the Returning Player Mission \[Normal 1-10 Gustav Clear\] redirected to a different stage.  
– Fixed an issue where, if the client was forcibly closed while the Guide Quest Tutorial was active, the game became unresponsive after logging back in.  
– Fixed an issue where entering the Hall of Fame while Core-Fused Veronica was placed caused a black screen.  
– Fixed an issue where, when the inventory was full and the player navigated from \[Lobby\] > \[Menu\] > \[Mass Sweep\] and initiated a sweep, moving to \[Inventory\] did not close the Mass Sweep window.  
– Fixed an issue where, in Nadza’s Guide Quest (Step 2), the description “Use 300 points at the Investigation Support Center” did not match the actual required points.  
– Fixed an issue where certain text appeared in Korean  
– Fixed an issue where, after clearing Story Season 1 Normal 4-6, the content-unlock message incorrectly referenced another content
