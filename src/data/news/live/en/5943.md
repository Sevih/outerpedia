Hello, Masters.  
This is Hyun Moon-soo, PD of OUTERPLANE.

Today, we would like to provide a more detailed explanation regarding the adjustment direction and update schedule for the Accuracy, Evasion, and Heals When Hit stats, which were previously mentioned in our advance notice.

Currently, the Accuracy and Evasion stats rely on a dual-check structure alongside Effectiveness/Resilience, which increases combat complexity and prevents these stats from demonstrating their intended effectiveness in certain content.  
Additionally, the Heals When Hit option has shown very limited practical value in actual combat situations.

To address these issues, the development team will be restructuring these stats with the goal of making them more intuitive and providing clearer, more meaningful impact during combat.

**■** Summary of Key Changes

1.  Accuracy → Damage Increase
2.  Evasion → (Enemy) Damage Reduction
3.  Heals When Hit → (Enemy) Reduced Critical Damage
4.  Accuracy / Evasion Gear Sets → Reworked into New Defensive Sets

* * *

**■** New Stat Application Details

The newly applied stats—Damage Increase, (Enemy) Damage Reduction, and (Enemy) Reduced Critical Damage—will all be incorporated into OUTERPLANE’s existing additive damage increase/decrease calculation system.

OUTERPLANE calculates final damage by summing and offsetting all damage increase and damage reduction effects originating from skills, transcendence, Quirks, and equipment.  
The newly introduced stats are designed to be included within this same calculation framework to prevent excessive efficiency in specific scenarios and to maintain overall balance.

※ Please note that Final Damage Increase / Final Damage Reduction are calculated in a separate formula layer and are currently applied only to a limited number of skill effects.
