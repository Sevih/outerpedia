![MVWAJwAAAAZJREFUAwCJV1obhfHW2AAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==](/images/news/live/en/158-base64-8-48d5837e.webp)

  

ㄴSchedule: 10/23/2025 (Thu) after the maintenance – 10/30/2025 (Thu) 00:00 UTC  
ㄴ Calculation Period: 10/30/2025 (Thu) 00:00 – 11/06/2025 (Thu) 00:00 UTC  
  
  
  
ㄴ Break Schedule: 11/06/2025 (Thu) 00:00 UTC – the start of the next season  
  
  
  
  
■ How to Play  
  
  
  
1) Battles will be conducted across two phases against Geas Guardians and the main boss.  
  
  
  
　ㄴ Phase 1: Consists of 5 stages where you must defeat 2 Geas Guardians in each stage.  
  
  
  
　ㄴ Phase 2: Collaborate with guild members to defeat the main boss.  
  
  
  
　ㄴ The main boss shares its Health with guild members, similar to the Geas Guardians.  
  
  
  
　ㄴ Clearing Phase 1 progresses the battle to Phase 2.  
  
  
  
　ㄴ If Phase 1 is not cleared within 2 days of the Guild Raid’s start, it automatically transitions to Phase 2 regardless of completion status.  
  
  
  
  
■ Special Entry Tickets  
  
  
  
\- If a boss is defeated when its health is below a certain threshold, you can obtain a Special Entry Ticket.  
  
  
  
\- Special Entry Tickets allow you to challenge the previous boss using the remaining turns.  
  
  
  
ㄴ e.g. If you clear a boss with 3 turns remaining after consuming a Guild Raid Ticket, you can use a Special Entry Ticket to proceed with those 3 turns.  
  
  
  
ㄴ Heroes used when earning a Special Entry Ticket are not marked as unavailable.  
  
  
  
ㄴ If both a Special Entry Ticket and a Guild Raid Ticket are available, the Special Entry Ticket is consumed first.  
  
  
  
ㄴ Special Entry Tickets expire at the daily reset time if unused.
