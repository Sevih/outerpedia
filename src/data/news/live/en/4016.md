Hello, Masters.

I’m Moonsoo Hyun, the PD leading the development of OUTERPLANE.

As we celebrate our 2.5-year anniversary, I’m truly grateful that we can continue this journey together.

Thanks to your constant support and feedback, our development team strives every day to make the game better.

Originally, we planned to release a video this week featuring a Q&A addressing your feedback and an updated roadmap.

However, as we worked on it, the amount of content we wanted to share grew, resulting in more time needed for editing and localization.

That’s entirely on us for not preparing thoroughly in advance.

We sincerely apologize for the delay and ask for your kind understanding as we take a bit more time to deliver a more polished and complete video.

Still, **there are a few important improvements** we’d like to share with you right away, so we decided to deliver them first in this letter.

-   **Major Improvements Coming in the Next Update (Scheduled for November 18)**

1.  **Limited Hero Recruitment Mileage Carryover**
    -   Previously, Mileage was converted into Star’s Memory when the event ended, but it will now carry over instead.
    -   The 150 Mileage cap for guaranteed recruitment using Limited Mileage will remain unchanged.
2.  **Duplicate Hero Recruitment Reward Adjustment**
    -   The number of hero pieces obtained when recruiting a duplicate non-pickup 3★ ally will be increased from 50 → 150.
    -   This adjustment, previously applied only during special events, will now be permanently applied.

These changes were among the first we discussed and finalized with our publisher, Major Nine, based directly on your feedback. Rather than waiting for the upcoming video, we wanted to share this news with you as soon as possible.

In addition to the ongoing 2.5-year anniversary event, we’re preparing a new story event and a new 3★ standard hero for the November 18 update.

Please wait just a little longer — in the upcoming Q&A video, we’ll share more details about our future direction and specific plans.

To all Masters who have continued to play OUTERPLANE, I sincerely thank you for being with us throughout these two and a half years.

The development team and I will continue to work with sincerity and dedication to meet — and exceed — your expectations.
