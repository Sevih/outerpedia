**3) ★3 Mystic Sage Ame**

In Arena and PvE content, when Mystic Sage Ame is the only remaining ally, her turn may not occur, causing battles to take an excessively long time to conclude. To address this issue, the effects and description of Mystic Sage Ame’s “Mandala” will be partially adjusted.  
  
\[Before**\]**

Reduces the caster’s Speed by 90%. When an ally takes a turn, performs an action, the caster uses Repent on the enemy with the highest Attack. Then, increase the caster’s Priority by 40%. (Irremovable, removed when the caster is stunned or when a Boss Break occurs)**  
  
\[After\]**

Reduces the caster’s Speed by 90%. When an ally gains a turn and takes an action, uses “Repent!” on the enemy with the highest Attack. Then, increases the caster’s \[Priority\] by 40%. (Irremovable. Removed when a Boss Break occurs or at the end of the caster’s turn. When the caster is the only surviving ally, the Speed reduction effect is removed and will not occur.)
