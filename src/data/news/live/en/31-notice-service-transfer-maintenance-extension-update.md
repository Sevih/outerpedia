Dear Masters,  
  
  
  
  
  
As a follow-up to the announcement made on September 24 regarding the service transfer extension, we would like to provide an update.  
  
  
  
  
  
The market transfer process (Google Play / Appstore) is taking longer than expected,  
  
  
and as a result, we will not be able to open the service today, September 26.  
  
  
  
  
  
We are working diligently to complete the remaining market process as quickly as possible.  
  
  
Once the schedule is confirmed, we will immediately provide an additional announcement.  
  
  
The detailed update notice will also be announced once the schedule is finalized.  
  
  
  
  
  
We deeply appreciate your patience and understanding.  
  
  
As previously mentioned, compensation will be prepared and delivered via in-game mail after the service resumes as a sincere apology.  
  
  
  
  
  
Thank you.
