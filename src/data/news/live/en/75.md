Dear Masters,

  

Following the recent service trasnfer, we’ve received many inquiries from players experiencing confusion with account access and transfer code.

  

Please check the information below and follow the steps to ensure you can continue playing with your existing account without any issues.

**Q. Service Transfer Code isn't working. What should I do?**

  

**1\. Check the code entry**

\- Re-enter the code exactly with the correct uppercase/lowercase letters and numbers.

\- If you copied and pasted, make sure there are no leading/trailing spaces and no missing characters.

  

**2\. Confirm your login account/platform**

\- Make sure you’re logged in with the same account and login platform (e.g., Google, Apple, Email) you entered your service transfer code with.

\- Note: Logging in with a different account or platform creates a new account, and the data transfer will not apply.

  

**3\. If you logged into a new account by mistake**

\- In game, go to Settings → Account → Log Out to return to the TAP TO START screen.

\- Select the correct account (Google/Apple/Email) and log in again.

\- On the title screen, tap the \[Enter Transfer Code\] button in the bottom right and input your code.

  

**Q. I lost / never got my transfer code. What should I do?**

  

**1\. If you have a STOVE account, please check the \[STOVE Transfer Code Confirmation\] page.**

\- STOVE Transfer code page: [https://outerplane.game.onstove.com/transfer](https://outerplane.game.onstove.com/transfer)

\- If you haven’t received a transfer code, you can get one after agreeing to the transfer agreement.

  

**2\. If you are unable to verify your STOVE account but have purchase history, please visit our customer support**

**Q. How do I use my Service Transfer Code?**

  

**A. To use your Service Transfer Code and restore your account, please follow the steps below:**

\- Start the game and log in with either a new account (Apple / Google / Email) or your original login method (Facebook, Twitter, and STOVE logins are not supported).

\- At the “TAP TO START” screen, tap the “Enter Transfer Code” button (bottom right).

\- Enter the transfer code you received and confirm.

\- Your previous account data will be restored and you can continue playing as before.

\- Please note once you enter the code, that login method will become your permanent way to access the game in the future.

  

**Q. What server should I go to?**

**A. You can only select previously chosen server, and you cannot change servers.**

\- If you were on ASIA I, ASIA II, or KOREA before the transfer, please log in to REGION\_GLB2.

\- If you were on Global 1 before the transfer, please log in to REGION\_GLB.

\- If you were on Japan before the transfer, please log in to REGION\_JAPAN.

**Q. I can’t enter my transfer code — it only shows a maintenance popup. What should I do?**

**1\. For iOS users**

\- The game is not yet available on the Apple App Store due to a pending review.

\- We will announce the iOS launch date separately once the review is complete.

\- For now, the game can only be accessed through Google Play.

**2\. For Google Play users**

\- If your app isn’t updated to the latest version, a maintenance popup may appear.

\- Please open the Google Play Store, check for updates, and make sure you’re running the most recent version of the game.
