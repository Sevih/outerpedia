Dear Masters,  
  
This is Hyun Moon-soo, PD of OUTERPLANE.

Following the January 27th update that introduced our new hero, Monad Iota, we have been taking very seriously the criticism and disappointment many of you have shared with us.

As this character had been revealed in advance during the recent offline meeting, we understand that expectations were especially high. We sincerely apologize for failing to meet those expectations in terms of performance and overall quality.

Our development team has carefully reviewed each piece of feedback submitted through the community and customer support channels, and based on that feedback, we plan to proceed with the following improvements.

**■ Planned Improvements for “Monad Iota”**

**1\. Performance Balance Adjustments**

We are closely analyzing player feedback regarding Monad Iota’s actual combat performance and practical usability. To ensure that the character’s concept and intended role are properly expressed on the battlefield, we are positively reviewing balance adjustments, including buffs.

Once details are finalized, we will share the full information through a separate notice.

**2\. Lobby Motion Adjustments**

We will review and revise key lobby animations, including entrance, idle, and growth motions.  
To better highlight each character’s appeal, the animations will be refined to be more natural and better suited to each character’s personality and style.

**3\. Re-recording and Revisions of Korean Character Voice Lines**

We fully agree with the feedback that some voice lines did not appropriately match the characters’ personalities or situations. As a result, we plan to re-record the Korean voice lines and make overall improvements to enhance the quality.
