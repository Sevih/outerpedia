Dear Masters,  
  
This is Hyun Moon-soo, PD of OUTERPLANE.

We sincerely apologize for the concern and inconvenience caused to our Masters due to the excessive difficulty and pattern design of the Season 4 main story boss, “Three Cries,” introduced in the recent update, which disrupted the enjoyment of the story.

Our development team designs and adjusts balance based on the following principle:  
“Main Story (Normal) difficulty should be clearable without excessive stress, within clear patterns and intended strategies.”

However, during the design of this boss, the skill effects required to execute the intended strategy were unreasonable, resulting in gameplay that felt frustrating rather than challenging.

In particular:

-   The boss’s immunity-ignore and Irremovable effects applied to all targets severely limited the effectiveness of healing and defensive heroes.
-   The removal of debuffs triggered during Freeze made it excessively difficult to utilize key Freeze-applying characters required for the strategy.

We take it very seriously that these issues occurred in Normal difficulty, not Hard.

We should have identified and prevented these problems through more thorough validation and broader testing in advance.  
This failure lies entirely with us, and as PD, I take full responsibility.

We are taking your feedback and criticism seriously, and as a result, we will immediately reduce the boss difficulty and revise the unreasonable patterns as outlined below.

* * *

\[Planned Adjustments\]

1\. Normal Difficulty

-   Remove the “Irremovable” attribute to allow sufficient counterplay against Burn effects, and limit “Ignores Immunity” to the Ultimate skill only. **and also remove “Ignores Immunity”.**
-   Adjust passive skill effects to ensure characters with Freeze effects can be used without restriction.
-   Revise balance so the stage can be cleared sufficiently using recommended Water-element compositions.

2\. Hard Difficulty

-   Maintain a challenging difficulty, while adjusting certain skill effects so strategies utilizing key characters can be executed more smoothly.

3\. Additional Improvements

-   To improve access to the key character Fortuna, who is used in the “Three Cries” encounter, she will be added to Custom Recruitment and the Doppelganger Dungeon.

\[Compensation Details\]

To apologize for the stress and inconvenience caused by this balance issue, we have prepared the following compensation:

Eligibility: All Masters

Distribution Period: After today’s non-maintenance patch until February 14, 2026, 00:00 (UTC)

Mailbox Retention: Rewards can be claimed for 7 days from the date of receipt

We will take this incident as a lesson and strive to ensure that future story content preserves its core enjoyment without unnecessary frustration.  
  
Thank you.
