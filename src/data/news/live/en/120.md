Greetings Master,

  

Weâ€™ve received a lot of feedback about Summer Knightâ€™s Dream Ember, especially regarding her performance compared to the effort required to obtain and grow her.

After reviewing your opinions carefully, weâ€™ve decided to strengthen her abilities to make her feel more rewarding to use.

  

We also know some players experienced inconvenience due to the update delay, so weâ€™re extending certain content and shop items as well.

Please check the details below.

1\. Damage Scale Adjustment â€“ Now HP-Based

\- Before: Damage scaled with both ATK and HP.

\- After: Now uses HP instead of ATK for damage calculation.

â†’ This change increases overall damage and removes the need to build both ATK and HP at the same time.

  

2\. Skill 1: Dolphin Charge!

\- Adds fixed damage equal to 10% of Emberâ€™s Max HP.

\- Added Increase damage on Burst effect

â†’ Gives her Basic Attack the same fixed-damage identity that defines her playstyle.

  

3\. Skill 2: Master, Spike!

\- Passive Effect: All allies take 10% less damage.

\- Active Effect:

\> Before attacking: Increases alliesâ€™ DEF and Penetration (2 turns)

\> After attacking: Increases her Priority by 20%

\> Damage increases by 10% per level

â†’ Improves her tank utility while keeping her offensive potential high.

  

4\. Skill 3: Sudden Strike!

\- Before: Increased Priority of all allies except herself.

\- After: Now increases Priority of all allies, including herself.

â†’ Allows faster team tempo and smoother battles.

  

5\. Chain Passive Improvement

\- Before: Activated only in Starter Exclusive

\- After: Can now activate from any Chain position (changed to Companion).

WG reduction rate: Adjusted from 5 â†’ 3, considering the wider usability.

â†’ Increases team composition flexibility and overall strategy options.

  

This update focuses on improving her usability at base level and raising her value when fully built.

With these changes, Amber will take on the role of a high-performance HP-based sweeper, offering strong utility and damage potential across both PvE and PvP modes.
