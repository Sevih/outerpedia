Hello, Masters.

  

We have identified an issue related to the ongoing \[Mirsha Festival\] event.

  

 ![üîé](/images/news/live/en/136-4f4791b4.svg)Known Issue

When entering the Demiurge Contract screen after receiving all 14 days of Attendance Rewards, an ‚ÄúInvalid Request‚Äù error message appears

\- This occurred because the attendance reward period was set to 14 days, but the event duration was not properly announced, which have caused confusion.

  

You can check the update on the patch note below:

\*Daily Missions and daily purchase with Ether are available until the maintenance on October 23 (Thu), and even if the ‚ÄúInvalid Request‚Äù message appears, pieces can still be claimed normally.
