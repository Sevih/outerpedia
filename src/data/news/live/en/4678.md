Dear Masters,

An issue has been identified in the Holy Night’s Blessing Diane Recruitment.

Although the mileage count is displayed correctly on the recruitment screen,  
the Mileage Recruit list does not appear, making the Recruit function unavailable.

Limited Mileage is being accumulated normally, and the issue is limited to the exchange UI not being displayed, which temporarily prevents the use of Mileage Recruit.

1\. Current Status

-   The issue has been confirmed, and an update containing the fix has been prepared.
-   The corrected version will be applied after the next round of store review and update.
-   The application timing may vary depending on the store review process.

2\. Future Schedule

-   Once the store review is completed, we will provide a separate notice with the patch schedule.

※ Additional Information

-   Limited Mileage is being accumulated normally, and mileage from previous Dimentional Crossroads is also properly carried over and reflected.
-   We are working to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused.  
Thank you for your understanding.
