ㄴ e.g. If you clear a boss with 3 turns remaining after consuming a Guild Raid Ticket, you can use a Special Entry Ticket to proceed with those 3 turns.  
  
  
  
ㄴ Heroes used when earning a Special Entry Ticket are not marked as unavailable.  
  
  
  
ㄴ If both a Special Entry Ticket and a Guild Raid Ticket are available, the Special Entry Ticket is consumed first.
