Hello, Masters.

This is Hyun Moonsu, PD of OUTERPLANE.

I would like to share the major changes coming in the upcoming update, specifically related to adjustments to Gear Set Effects and improvements to Monad Gate.

Based on your feedback, we focused on enhancing both the strategic depth and overall convenience of the game.

**Gear Set Effect Adjustments**

To improve the overall usability of armor-type gear sets, several set effects will be adjusted.

This is the first phase of our broader gear balance update, with additional adjustments planned for the future.

▶ Key Adjustment Directions

**1\. Damage-type gear sets enhanced:**  
The values of the **Attack**, **Critical Strike**, **Weakness**, **Augmentation**, and **Pulverization** gear sets will be slightly increased, as their efficiency has been below expectation.

**2\. More flexible set configurations:**  
The **Critical Strike** and **Pulverization** gear sets will be changed to provide effects for both 2-piece and 4-piece combinations, enabling more diverse builds.

**3\. Improved early-game access to Critical Hit gear:**  
The **Critical Hit** gear’s set values will be slightly increased to better support Masters in early-game..

**4\. Penetration & Speed set rearrangement:**  
The effects of the 2-piece/4-piece **Penetration** and **Speed** sets will be rearranged for subtle but noticeable efficiency gains when combined.

**5\. Lifesteal set enhanced**:  
The maximum lifesteal cap will be increased from 20% → 25%.

**6\. Accuracy/Evasion sets unchanged (under review):**  
Accuracy/Evasion mechanics affect combat broadly, so these sets will remain unchanged in this update.  
Their potential removal or restructuring is still under review, and we will share details once the direction is finalized.

**Monad Gate Improvements**

As mentioned in the previous Developer Letter, the first wave of Monad Gate improvements—focusing on rewards and quality-of-life—will be applied in this update.  
The goal is to reduce content fatigue by allowing Masters to earn meaningful rewards with just one clear per week.

▶ Key Adjustment Directions

**1\. Reward Improvements & Fusion-type Core Additions**

– Ether added to True Ending clears:  
A small amount of Ether will now be awarded for clearing Depth 1–5 True Endings.  
– Report Reward Upgrade:  
All Report rewards will be increased.  
Masters who previously obtained profile frames or titles will continue to keep and use them.  
– Fusion-type Core:  
_Fusion-type Cores_ used for Core Fusion will now be rewarded as the final boss clear reward for each route.  
As a result, Fusion-type Cores will no longer appear in Arena weekly rewards or Event Dungeon Hard difficulty.  
– Weekly Mission Rewards:  
Weekly missions will grant a small amount of Ether.  
Exact reward quantities will be announced in the update notice.

**2\. Progression System Improvements  
**  
To improve convenience and reduce content fatigue, the progression flow of Monad Gate will be updated:

– Weekly Exploration Count:  
Masters will receive 1 weekly exploration attempt, consumed only when the reward is claimed.  
(If you give up mid-run, you may choose whether to claim rewards.)  
– Depth Unlock System:  
A new “Required Exploration Count for Next Depth” condition will be added.  
This count increases each time you view an ending and claim rewards.  
– Route Node Reduction:  
Depth 6–10 routes will have their total nodes reduced from 60 → 54 (a 10% reduction).  
– New Relic Category:  
A new “Universal” category will be added, containing relics that increase basic ally stats.

**As part of these changes, all Masters’ Monad Report progress and current route progression will be reset. Please complete your current route and claim your rewards before the update.**

This first phase focuses on reducing fatigue and improving reward value.  
Further adjustments—such as total play frequency—may be considered after analyzing user data and feedback.

We are also reviewing and developing additional adjustments to further enhance the core fun of the Monad Gate experience, so please look forward to the next round of improvements as well.
