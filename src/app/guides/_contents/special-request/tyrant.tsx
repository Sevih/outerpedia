Units with AoE cleansing are very important, and once cleansed, you must use Burst Skills, Dual Attacks, and Chain Skills to damage his weakness gauge."

                                <li>Upon entering the battle, you will be instantly stacked with <EffectInlineTag name="BT_DOT_POISON" type="debuff" />, <EffectInlineTag name="BT_DOT_BLEED" type="debuff" />, and <EffectInlineTag name="BT_DOT_LIGHTNING" type="debuff" /> but so will the boss.</li>
                                <li>These DoTs will kill you very quickly if not cleansed immediately.</li>
                                <li>Since they are applied at the start of battle, <EffectInlineTag name="SYS_REVENGE_HEAL" type="buff" /> that cleanse like <CharacterLinkCard name="Tio" />, <CharacterLinkCard name="Meva" />, <CharacterLinkCard name="Stella" /> will not trigger.</li>
                                <li>Units with AoE cleansing are very important.</li>
                                <li><CharacterLinkCard name="Dianne" />&#39;s S3 completely trivializes this boss by cleansing the full duration of all debuffs.</li>
                                <li><CharacterLinkCard name="Saeran" />&#39;s Skill 2 Burst 2 is also viable, but you need to build enough AP in the first area to use it immediately.</li>
                                <li><CharacterLinkCard name="Shu" />&#39;s Skill 3 is viable but only cleanse 2 debuffs.</li>
                                <li><CharacterLinkCard name="Monad Eva" />&#39;s Skill 1 Burst 3 works too but you need her 5 star and AP.</li>
                                <li>Once cleansed, you must use <strong>Burst Skills</strong>, <strong>Dual Attacks</strong>, and <strong>Chain Skills</strong> to damage his WG.</li>
                                <li>Try to burst him down quickly since his damage increases rapidly over time.</li>
                                <li>Stage 12: Increases the speed of <ClassInlineTag name="Healer" /> and <ClassInlineTag name="Defender" /> by 50%, and makes their damage scale with their defense. All other classes deal 95% less damage.</li>
                                <li>Stage 13: Fully reduces Critical Hit chance and reduces the damage of all classes except <ClassInlineTag name="Defender" /> by 95%.</li>
